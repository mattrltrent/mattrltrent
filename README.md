Hey, I'm Matthew, a software focused university student from Abbotsford, Canada. 

### My Story
Iâ€™m currently an eighteen-year-old undergraduate student studying computer science at the University of Victoria. Derivable from my degree, I have a passion for tech.

Additionally, Iâ€™m a strong student. I won the Excellence scholarship at UVic for achieving a
96%+ average in grade twelve academic courses. Currently, I'm also a straight A+ student.

Finally, Iâ€™m an athlete. I thoroughly enjoy triathlons, running, and fitness in general.

### Who I Am
I started my developer journey in the tenth grade. At school, I was tasked
with creating a final project for history class that would be due in a couple months. I decided
my project would be a full-fledged video game. This was an insane undertaking for someone whoâ€™d
never coded before.

However, after 176.5 hours of being glued to my computer and reading
multiple C# books, I completed the (in hindsight terribly coded) project and received an A+.
Creating this video game got me hooked on development.

### Goals
Simply to combine business and tech to create something magical that provides value to some group of people.
