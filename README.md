#### Who I Am
I’m currently an eighteen-year-old undergraduate student studying computer science at the University of Victoria (BC, Canada). Derivable from my degree, I have a passion for tech. Additionally, this love for software often bubbles over into the world of finance, pushing me to also further my business knowledge.
#### My Story
I started my developer journey in the tenth grade. At school, I was tasked with creating a final project for history class that would be due in a couple months. I decided my project would be a full-fledged video game. This was an insane undertaking for someone who’d never coded before. However, after 176.5 hours of being glued to my computer and reading multiple C# books, I completed the (in hindsight terribly coded) project and received an A+. Creating this video game got me hooked on development.

#### Goals
Simply to combine business and tech to create something magical that provides value to some group of people.
