#### Who I Am
I’m currently a nineteen-year-old undergraduate student studying computer science at the University of Victoria (BC, Canada). Derivable from my degree, I have a passion for tech. Additionally, this love for software often bubbles over into the world of finance, pushing me to also further my business knowledge.
