Hey, I'm Matthew, a software focused university student from Abbotsford, Canada. 

### My Story
I started my developer journey in the tenth grade. At school, I was tasked with creating a final project for history class. I decided my project would be a full-fledged video game. This was an insane undertaking for someone whoâ€™d never coded before. However, after 176.5 hours of being glued to my computer and reading multiple C# books, I completed the project and received an A+. This got me hooked on development.

Since then, Iâ€™ve read several books, completed a myriad of courses, finished a couple development bootcamps, completed dozens of projects, and worked professionally for a couple businesses. These undertakings have gifted me the privilege of becoming proficient in a variety of languages, frameworks, and technologies.

### Who I Am
Iâ€™m currently an eighteen-year-old undergraduate student studying business at the University of Victoria. Despite academically pursuing a commerce degree, I have a passion for everything computer science. In the future, Iâ€™m confident Iâ€™ll be able to create something magical utilizing the combined power of these two areas of expertise.

Additionally, Iâ€™m a strong student. Iâ€™ve been awarded valuable scholarships for achieving a high 90s average throughout highschool, alongside a 96 academic course average in grade twelve.

Finally, Iâ€™m an athlete. I thoroughly enjoy triathlons, running, and fitness in general. These activities help keep me sane while Iâ€™m deep in the digital reality that is software development.

### Goals
Simply to combine business and tech to create something magical that provides value to some group of people.
